The data gathering process involved scraping headlines and timestamps from online archives of financial news publications to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis. The headlines and timestamps were collected from Reuters, The Wall Street Journal, and Financial Times, three of the most widely read and respected financial news organizations in the world.

To ensure that the dataset was representative and comprehensive, the scraping process covered a three-month period during Tesla's transition from a bearish to a bullish phase in the stock market. This period was chosen because it was a critical time for the company, and it offered a broad range of news and analysis that could be analyzed to gain insights into the financial news cycle.

Once the data was collected, it was cleaned and prepared for analysis. This process involved removing duplicates and irrelevant data points, standardizing the format of the headlines and timestamps, and ensuring that the data was accurate and reliable.

After the data preparation process, the dataset was analyzed using a range of quantitative and qualitative methods.
